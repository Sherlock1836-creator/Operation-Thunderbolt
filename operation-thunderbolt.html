                    <p><strong>June 27, 1976.</strong> Air France Flight 139 has been hijacked by Palestinian and German terrorists. The plane, with 248 passengers and crew, has been diverted first to Libya and then to Entebbe Airport in Uganda, where President Idi Amin provides shelter to the hijackers.</p>
                    <p>The terrorists separate Israeli and Jewish passengers from others. Non-Jewish hostages are released, but 106 remain captive, along with the Air France crew who refuse to abandon them.</p>
                    <p>The hijackers demand the release of 53 militants imprisoned in Israel and other countries. The deadline: <strong>July 1st</strong>. The consequence: execution of hostages.</p>
                    <p>Israel faces an impossible choice—until, armed with overhead pictures of the airport taken by a spy, information from released hostages, and brainstorming from their best military minds, they are ready to do the unthinkable—a daring raid 2,500 miles from home.</p>
                    <p>Israel managed to get the deadline extended until July 4, 1976, which happened to also be the Bicentennial of the United States. On that day, they finally had enough information, and the raid took place.</p>

                    <p>You think about the plan. The intelligence suggests there are four terrorists, but rumors say there might be more. The element of surprise is everything.</p>

                    <p>This is actually what happened. Yoni tried to shoot the sentries with a silenced gun, but missed one and only succeeded in wounding the other. A commando from the Land Rover behind him managed to eliminate both, but with an unsilenced weapon.</p>
                    <p>The raiding party was afraid that they had given away the element of surprise, but that doesn't seem to have been the case.</p>
                    <p>The Mercedes continues toward the terminal. You burst through the entrance. Inside, the terrorists are caught completely off-guard despite the gunshots outside. Your team engages with deadly precision.</p>
                    <p>"Terrorists! Drop your weapons!" The shots are clean, professional. Within seconds, all four terrorists in the main hall are down.</p>

                    <p>The unsilenced shots at the sentries caused momentary concern, but the terrorists inside remained unaware until it was too late. The raid lasted 53 minutes and became legend—a demonstration of Israel's reach and resolve.</p>

                    <p>This option wasn't tried—we will never know.</p>
                    <p>You decide to trust Yoni's deputy's assessment. The Mercedes drives past the sentries, who remain at attention. Perhaps they do think this is a ceremonial arrival. Perhaps they're simply confused.</p>
                    <p>But what happens next is uncertain. Would the sentries have maintained their salute long enough for the assault to begin? Would they have raised the alarm? Would avoiding their elimination have preserved the element of surprise more completely, or would it have created a threat from behind?</p>
                    <p>In the actual operation, the sentries were eliminated. That choice was made in the heat of the moment by soldiers who had to weigh split-second decisions against unknown risks.</p>

                    <p>This scenario represents a choice that wasn't made during the actual Operation Thunderbolt. The commandos chose to eliminate the sentries, despite complications with silenced weapons.</p>
                    <p>Would ignoring them have worked? We can never know. What we do know is that the men who made these decisions in real-time, under enormous pressure, succeeded in rescuing 102 hostages from 2,500 miles away.</p>
                    <p>Their choices—right or wrong, clean or messy—saved lives. That's what matters.</p>

                    <p>Of course that is the obvious answer—Yoni gave up his life and all of his unfulfilled dreams. Yet I find some comfort in knowing that this was exactly the way Yoni wanted to live his life.</p>
                    <p>In a 1963 letter, he wrote: <em>"The trouble with the youth here is that their lives are meager in content. I ought to be ready at every moment of my life to confront myself and say—'This is what I've done.'"</em></p>
                    <p>Yoni lived by those words. Every moment of his life had meaning. Every decision reflected his values. When he led his team into Entebbe, he wasn't just following orders—he was living out his deepest convictions about duty, courage, and protecting his people.</p>
                    <p>He died at age 30, but he lived more fully in those 30 years than most people do in 80. That's not a consolation for his loss, but it's a testament to who he was. The mission bears his name now: Operation Yonatan. That's fitting. He embodied everything it represented.</p>

                    <p>The way Sorin was shot and paralyzed by a Ugandan soldier meant that he was a hero every single day for the rest of his life, willing himself to go on, and achieving so much even in his incapacitated state.</p>
                    <p>We gave him a medal and tried to give him all the veteran benefits he needed, but nothing can compensate him for what he lost.</p>
                    <p>Yoni's heroism was concentrated in one moment—a bullet, a death, an end. Sorin's heroism has no end. Every morning he wakes up paralyzed. Every day he faces the reality of what he sacrificed. And every day he chooses to keep going.</p>
                    <p>He learned to use a wheelchair. He rebuilt his life. He advocated for other disabled veterans. Decades later, he even returned to Entebbe—not to relive trauma, but to show that the operation hadn't broken him.</p>
                    <p>When people ask me about heroes, I think of Sorin. Because heroism isn't just about what you're willing to die for—it's about what you're willing to live for, even when living is the harder choice.</p>

                    <p><strong>Michel Bacos</strong></p>
                    <p>The pilot of the Air France plane refused to leave the hostages, even when the hijackers allowed him to. His example gave such inspiration to all of our hostages and showed them that they have many friends in the nations of the world.</p>
                    <p>Captain Michel Bacos was French. He had no obligation to stay. The hijackers weren't targeting him—they were targeting Israelis and Jews. He could have walked away with the other non-Jewish passengers. No one would have blamed him.</p>
                    <p>But he looked at his passengers—terrified, separated from their families, facing execution—and he said no. "I will not leave my passengers," he told the hijackers. His entire crew stayed with him.</p>
                    <p>That decision changed everything for the hostages. They weren't alone. They had people who chose to stand with them, even at great personal risk. In those dark days in the terminal, Bacos and his crew provided food, comfort, and most importantly, solidarity.</p>
                    <p>When the rescue succeeded, Bacos didn't seek glory. He simply said he'd done what any decent person would do. But we both know that's not true. Most people wouldn't have done what he did. That's what made him a hero.</p>

                    <p><strong>Ninnette Morenu</strong></p>
                    <p>Believe it or not, we might owe her more than anyone else! Because of her non-Jewish sounding name, the hijackers allowed her to leave with the non-Jewish passengers. She had carefully observed the layout of the terminal, the positioning of the guards, and many crucial details.</p>
                    <p>She was able to sketch all that for the commandos, and her information made the military option a realistic choice.</p>
                    <p>When Ninnette was released, she could have simply gone home, grateful to have survived. Instead, she immediately went to Israeli intelligence and provided detailed drawings of the terminal—the positions of doors, windows, where the terrorists stood guard, where the hostages slept.</p>
                    <p>That intelligence was invaluable. We'd been working with architectural plans and satellite photos, but Ninnette gave us ground truth. She told us what the terrorists' routines were, when they were most alert, when they relaxed. Her information helped us refine our assault plan and probably saved lives.</p>
                    <p>Years later, her son Emanuel became one of the most decorated and capable Israeli soldiers ever. Sadly and heroically, he gave his life in battle for his people. Some of his missions are still too classified to reveal to the public.</p>
                    <p>A mother who helped save hostages, and a son who followed in her footsteps of service and sacrifice. The Morenu family embodies the best of what it means to serve something larger than yourself.</p>
